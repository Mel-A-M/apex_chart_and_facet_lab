# Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We value the independent security research community and believes that responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities helps us ensure the security and privacy of all our users.

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please submit a report to secalert_us@oracle.com preferably with a proof of concept. Please refer to [Reporting Vulnerabilities](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/reporting.html) for additional information including our public encryption key for secure email. We ask that you do not contact project contributors directly or through other channels about a report.
