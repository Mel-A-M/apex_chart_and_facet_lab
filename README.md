# Oracle APEX andn 

## Lab Introduction

![Autonomous](./images/adb_oac_banner2.png)

In this hands-on lab, you will get first-hand experience of using Oracle Cloud, **Oracle Autonomous Database (ADB)** and **Oracle APEX **.

**Oracle Autonomous Database (ADB)** delivers a self-driving, self-securing,self-repairing database service that can instantly scale to meet demands. The service supports two workload types:

-   **Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW)** provides an autonomous warehousing environment, associated with fast query performance.

-   **Oracle Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP)** provides an autonomous online transaction processing and mixed workload environment.

For the purpose of this lab, we will use **ADW** so all the steps will be related to this database service.

**Oracle Analytics Cloud (OAC)** is a scalable and secure public cloud service that provides a full set of capabilities to explore and perform collaborative analytics for you, your workgroup, and your enterprise.

With **Oracle Analytics Cloud**, you also get flexible service management capabilities, including fast setup, easy scaling and patching, and automated lifecycle management.

To run the lab, you will need an Oracle Free Tier Account, with a provisioned ADW instance and a a provisioned OAC instance. This pre-requisite guide will take you step-by-step through how to get the account and set the instance up, to be ready to start the lab.
